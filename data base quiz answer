 1. What is data?

Data is a collection of raw facts and figures that have not yet been processed into a meaningful form. It can be anything from numbers and letters to images and sounds.

2. What is information?

Information is data that has been processed into a meaningful form. It is something that can be understood and used to make decisions.

3. What is a database (DB)?

A database is a collection of organized data that is stored electronically. It is designed to make it easy to access, manage, and update the data.

4. What is a relational database management system (RDBMS)?

A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a software application that allows users to create, manage, and access relational databases. Relational databases store data in tables, which are made up of rows and columns. Each row represents a single record, and each column represents a single attribute of that record.

5. Define the importance of a relational database management system (RDBMS).

RDBMSs are important because they provide a number of benefits, including:

Data integrity
Data security
Data scalability
Data performance
6. What is the difference between a relational database (SQL) and a non-relational database (NoSQL)?

 Relational databases (SQL) are based on the relational model of data, which stores data in tables.
 Non-relational databases (NoSQL) do not use the relational model of data and can store data in a variety of formats, such as documents, graphs, and key-value pairs.

7. List examples of relational database management systems (RDBMS).

Some popular relational database management systems include:

MySQL
PostgreSQL
Oracle Database
Microsoft SQL Server
IBM DB2
8. List examples of non-relational databases (NoSQL).

Some popular non-relational databases include:

MongoDB
CouchDB
Cassandra
Redis
HBase

9. Define and describe Structured Query Language (SQL).

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language that is used to access and manipulate data in relational databases. It is the standard language for querying relational databases.

SQL can be used to perform a variety of operations, including:

Creating and deleting databases and tables
Inserting, updating, and deleting data in tables
Querying data from tables
Creating views and procedures

10. List and describe each of the different subsets of SQL (DDL, DML, DCL, and TCL).

SQL is divided into four subsets:

DDL (Data Definition Language)
DML (Data Manipulation Language)
DCL (Data Control Language)
TCL (Transaction Control Language) transactions.

11. What is a table in a database (DB)?

A table in a database is a collection of data that is organized into rows and columns. Each row represents a single record, and each column represents a single attribute of that record.

12. What is a column and row (tuples) in a table?

A column in a table is a vertical column of data. It represents a single attribute of the records in the table.

A row in a table is a horizontal row of data. It represents a single record in the table.
